<h1> What has changed in skalibs </h1>

<h2> in 2.0.0.0 </h2>

<ul>
 <li> The packaging system has completely changed. </li>
 <li> Programs should now link with <tt>-lskarnet</tt> followed by the appropriate
sysdeps links. </li>
 <li> No compatibility is ensured. Most APIs haven't changed, but no guarantee
is offered. </li>
 <li> The most important change is probably the disparition of <tt>struct tai</tt>
and <tt>struct taia</tt>, replaced with the <tt>tai_t</tt> and <tt>tain_t</tt>
types. Attosecond precision has been removed - processor speed is almost capped now,
and it looks like nanosecond precision will be enough for the foreseeable future. </li>
 <li> Buffer implementation has changed, and some interfaces too, mainly the
buffer_flush and bufalloc_flush return code. </li>
 <li> skaclient, skalibs' client-server communication suite, has been
entirely reimplemented: it's now using the new "unixmessage" set of primitives
for easier fd-passing. </li>
</ul>
